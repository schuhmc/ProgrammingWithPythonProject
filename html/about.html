    <h1>About this project</h1>
    <p>
        I built this weatherstation in the beginning of 2021 out of pure interest. This website was then generated for a university course.<br>
    All the parts were designed myself and 3D-printed using a modifed Ender3 printer. The 3D-Model is available <a href="https://cad.onshape.com/documents/04c854c0f53ba42df5e73bfd/w/24d3184f70b79871e2c529f7/e/5aebe767944fabda8e7f98c1">here</a> and all the code to generate the summaries and plots is available on my github <a href="https://github.com/schuhmc/ProgrammingWithPythonProject">here</a>.

    <h3>Components</h3>

    The brain of the weatherstation consists of an ESP8266 DevKit powered by a single 18650 Li-Ion battery which is charged through four small solar panels. The data is generated by the following sensors:

    <ul>
        <li>Bosch BME680: Temperature, Humidity, Pressure and Air Quality</li>
        <li>GY-906 DAA (MLX90614): Sky Temperature</li>
        <li>TSL2591: Illumination</li>
        <li>A hall sensor and two magnets for the Anemometer</li>
    </ul>

    Apart from that there's some resistors, voltage and charging regulators. And hot glue. Lots of hot glue.<br><br>

    And here's what it looks like:<br>
